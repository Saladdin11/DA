CTE - A NAMED TEMPORARY RESULT SET - ONLY CREATED IN MEMORY NOT A FILE 
EXAMPLE:

WITH CTE_EMPLOYEE AS
(select FirstName, LASTNAME, GENDER, SALARY, 
COUNT(GENDER) OVER (PARTITION BY GENDER) AS TOTALGENDER
, avg(salary) over (PARTITION BY GENDER) AS AvgSALARY
From EmployeeDemographics1 DEM
JOIN employeeSalary SAL
ON DEM.EmployeeID = SAL.EmployeeID
WHERE SALARY > '40000' )

SELECT * FROM CTE_EMPLOYEE

OR COULD DO 

SELECT FirstName, AVGSALARY
FROM CTE_EMPLOYEE
                            BUT THE CTE QUERY MUST BE IN THE SAME QUERY PAGE
                            
                            

 USING TRIM:
 
SELECT EmployeeID, Trim(EmployeeID) as IDTrim
FROM EmployeeErrors
                        this produces a table which has removed any extra gaps in data points across both coloumns - LTRIM AND RTRIM, are used 
                        to clean up a right or left coloumn 
                      
USING REPLACE 

select Lastname, REPLACE(Lastname, '- Fired','' ) As LastNameFixed
From EmployeeErrors 
                      THIS HAS REMOVED "- Fired" and replaced it with a blank space - the result table shows the last names and the fixed Lnames
 
 USING SUBSTRING
