# Second step in data cleaning proccess is to stanardise our data
#MySQL provides a variety of string functions that you can use to standardize the format of your data. 
#For example, you can use the LOWER() or UPPER() functions to convert text to lower or upper case, the TRIM() function to remove leading and trailing whitespace, and the DATE_FORMAT() function to standardize the format of date values.

SELECT phone, REGEXP_REPLACE(phone, '[()-/+]','')  #Can add any characters between '' to remove from a list
FROM bakery.customer_sweepstakes ;  

# Now to replace the table with the new numbers 

UPDATE bakery.customer_sweepstakes
SET phone = REGEXP_REPLACE(phone, '[()-/+]','')
;

#However we should include a '-' in our new format and this can  be done using SUBSTRING  and CONCAT 
# STEP 1 Standardise phone numbers 

SELECT phone, CONCAT(SUBSTRING(phone,1,3),'-',SUBSTRING(phone,4,3),'-',SUBSTRING(phone,7,4))
FROM bakery.customer_sweepstakes
WHERE phone <> '' ;  

UPDATE bakery.customer_sweepstakes
SET phone = CONCAT(SUBSTRING(phone,1,3),'-',SUBSTRING(phone,4,3),'-',SUBSTRING(phone,7,4))
WHERE phone<> '' ; 

#Standardising Dates
# Firslty we need to ensure that the coloumn is not a text datatype and instead set to date data type
# we do this by using STR_TO_DATE

# had issues with 2 dates which were formatted in reverse so targetting them first by using substring to break down dates 

SELECT birth_date, SUBSTRING(birth_date, 9,2),SUBSTRING(birth_date, 6,2),SUBSTRING(birth_date, 1,4)
FROM bakery.customer_sweepstakes ;

SELECT birth_date, CONCAT(SUBSTRING(birth_date, 9,2),'/',SUBSTRING(birth_date, 6,2),'/',
SUBSTRING(birth_date, 1,4))
FROM bakery.customer_sweepstakes ;

#Updated the table to edit these 2 tricky dates first and used 'sweepstake_ID' to specify them

UPDATE bakery.customer_sweepstakes 
SET birth_date = CONCAT(SUBSTRING(birth_date, 9,2),'/',SUBSTRING(birth_date, 6,2),'/',
SUBSTRING(birth_date, 1,4)) 
WHERE sweepstake_id IN (9,11) 

# Now can format rest of dates easily from Text to string and in below format Y/M/D

UPDATE bakery.customer_sweepstakes
SET birth_date = STR_TO_DATE(birth_date,'%Y/%m/%d')

#STANDARDISING YES or NO coloumns 

SELECT `Are you over 18?`,         # SELECT coloumn with Y/N question and use a CASE statement 
CASE
WHEN `Are you over 18?` = 'Yes' THEN 'Y'
WHEN `Are you over 18?` = 'No' THEN 'N'
ELSE `Are you over 18?`                        #Need an ELSE for answers that are already Y/N 
END 
AS Formatted 
FROM bakery.customer_sweepstakes;
