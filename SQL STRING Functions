Select * 
From Customers

Select first_name, LENGTH(first_name) 
From Customers
Order by LENGTH(first_name)
   ## this output wil give us all the first names in order of the number of characters from lowest to highest 

Select first_name, UPPER(first_name) 
From Customers
## This replaces all text with uppercaps and the same can be done with LOWER - helpful when cleaning data to standardise data 

##LTRIM and RTRIM trim the white space from either L or R of data - TRIM removes white space from both sides 

Select LEFT('Alexander', 4)  ## This will select the first 4 letters from alexander

Select first_name, LEFT(first_name,3) 
From Customers;
  ## This willselect only the first 3 letters from that coloumn and same can be done with RIGHT 

##Substring allows you to specify a start point and how many characters you want to take from any part of the string. 

SELECT SUBSTRING('Alexander,2,3)   # so this starts from the second character and moves 3 positions to the left 
Result = 'lex'
      ## This is great for cleaning phone number data

From Customers               ## This will select the first 3 digits of the phone number 

SELECT phone, SUBSTRING(phone,1,3)SUBSTRING(phone,5,3),SUBSTRING(phone,9,4)
From Customers 
## ^ This will remove characters 4,8 which were '-' in the phone numbers 

SELECT REPLACE(first_name, 'a', 'z')     ##This looks in the first name coloumns and replaces any a  with z
