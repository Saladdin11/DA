Calculate Average salary:

SELECT JobTitle, avg(Salary)
fROM EmployeeDemographics1
Inner JOIN EmployeeSalary
ON EmployeeDemographics1.EmployeeID = EmployeeSalary.EmployeeID
Where JobTitle = 'salesman' 
Group by JobTitle


Merging tables with Union       - this produces a merged table where duplicates are removed

Select *
From EmployeeDemographics1
Union
Select *
From WareHouseEmployeeDemographics
order by EmployeeID

To merge tables and include duplicates:
Select *
From EmployeeDemographics1
Union All
Select *
From WareHouseEmployeeDemographics
order by EmployeeID


CASE STATEMENTS:    - To specifiy condition and specifiy what you want returned when that condition is met 
E.G when age is more than 30 then label old or young. 

Select FirstName, LastName, Age,
Case 
When Age > 30 Then 'Old' Else 'Young' 
End 
FROM EmployeeDemographics1
WHERE AGE IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY AGE 

Example 2 

Select FirstName, LastName, Age,
Case 
When Age > 30 Then 'Old' 
When age between 27 and 30 then 'young' Else 'Baby'  -
End 
FROM EmployeeDemographics1
WHERE AGE IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY AGE 

WE can keep adding Whens but first 'when' is what SQL sees as most important

ADDING A RAISE TO EVERYONES SALARY - EXAMPLES

Select FirstName, LastName, JobTitle, Salary,
Case
	WHEN Jobtitle = 'Salesman' Then Salary + (Salary * .10)
	When Jobtitle = 'Accountant' Then Salary + (Salary * 0.05) 
	When  Jobtitle = 'HR' Then Salary + (Salary * 0.00001) 
Else Salary + (Salary * 0.03)
End as SalaryAfterRaise
FROM EmployeeDemographics1
join EmployeeSalary
on EmployeeDemographics1.EmployeeID = EmployeeSalary.EmployeeID

HAVING CLAUSE 

Select JobTitle, Count(JobTitle) 
FROM EmployeeDemographics1
Join EmployeeSalary 
on EmployeeDemographics1.EmployeeID = EmployeeSalary.EmployeeID
Group BY JobTitle 
HAVING COUNT(JOBTITLE) > 1 

	THIS SHOWS US WHICH JOBS HAVE MORE THAN ONE EMPLOYEE - IT TELLS US HOW MANY EMPLOYEES ARE FOR EACH JOB TITLE 



Select JobTitle, avg(Salary) 
FROM EmployeeDemographics1
Join EmployeeSalary 
on EmployeeDemographics1.EmployeeID = EmployeeSalary.EmployeeID
Group BY JobTitle
HAVING AVG(SALARY) > 40000        MUST COME AFTER GROUP BY STATEMENT 
ORDER BY AVG(SALARY)   

	THIS SHOWS US WHOS AVERAGE SALARY IS HIGHER THAN 40K IN ORDER OF OF LOWEST SALARY FIRST
