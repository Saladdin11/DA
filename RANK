#RANK() and DENSE_RANK() are both window functions in SQL that assign a unique rank to each row within a partition of a result set.

#RANK() function assigns a unique rank to each distinct row within a partition but leaves gaps in the ranking for tied rows. If two (or more) rows tie for a rank, each tied rows receives the same rank, and then the next rank in the sequence is skipped. For example, if two rows tie for rank 1, RANK() gives both rows a rank of 1, but the next row receives a rank of 3.

#DENSE_RANK() function also assigns a unique rank to each distinct row within a partition, but unlike RANK(), it does not skip any ranks. If two (or more) rows tie for a rank, each tied rows receives the same rank, and the next row receives the next rank in the sequence. For example, if two rows tie for rank 1, DENSE_RANK() gives both rows a rank of 1, and the next row receives a rank of 2.

SELECT *, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC)
FROM bakery.employees

SELECT *
FROM (SELECT *, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank_row
FROM bakery.employees) AS ranked
WHERE rank_row < 3

SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC)
FROM bakery.employees
