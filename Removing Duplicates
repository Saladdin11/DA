#1 Finding Duplicates
#Example duplicate customer records based on customer ID

SELECT customer_id, COUNT(Customer_id)
FROM bakery.customer_sweepstakes
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(customer_id) > 1 ;

# Another way to do identify duplicates is to use window functions:

SELECT Customer_id, 
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Customer_id) AS Row_num
FROM bakery.customer_sweepstakes
  #Results in showing all ids with 2 records - then we can use this as our subquery 
#2
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT Customer_id, 
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Customer_id) AS Row_num
FROM bakery.customer_sweepstakes) AS table_row
WHERE Row_num > 1 ; 

#DELETING the duplicate Records we have just identified 

DELETE FROM bakery.customer_sweepstakes
WHERE sweepstake_id IN (
	SELECT sweepstake_id              #THIS TIME WE ONLY NEED TO SELECT THE SWEEPSTAKE ID 
	FROM (SELECT sweepstake_id, 
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Customer_id) AS Row_num
		FROM bakery.customer_sweepstakes) AS table_row
		WHERE Row_num > 1 );
