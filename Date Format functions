#Date and Date Format functions 

##CURDATE - shows current date
##CURTIME - shows current time 

SELECT Now() # can be used at end of a report so when its run it keeps track of time n date it was run 

SELECT YEAR(NOW()) ;
SELECT MONTH(NOW()) ;
#

SELECT * 
WHERE YEAR(birth_date) = YEAR(NOW()) 
## this looks for a birthdate which is the same year as now - we can use this in several ways

SELECT * 
FROM customer_orders
WHERE YEAR(order_date) = Year(NOW()) - 1 
  ## This is now aksing to get order info from last year 


## Example 2 
SELECT * 
FROM customer_orders
WHERE MONTH(order_date) = MONTH(NOW()) - 1 

SELECT DAYNAME(NOW()); 
## GIVES US THE CURRENT DAY 

SELECT order_date, DAYNAME(order_date) 
FROM customer_orders
## shows us which days orders were made on, useful for looking at consumer behavioural patterns
## can also be done with MONTHNAME 

#DATEFORMAT - takes existing date formats into a newone 

SELECT birth_date,
FROM customers;
#we can change date formats using:

SELECT birth_date, DATE_FORMAT(birth_date,'%M %d %'Y' 
FROM customers;
## this is customisable can also add - 
# capital M gets us the name of the month
