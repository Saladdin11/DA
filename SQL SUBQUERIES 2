# Using Subqueries in SELECT and FROM statements 

SELECT product_id, quanity, AVG(quantity) 
FROM ordered_items
#this doesnt work as AVG(quantity) wont be read by sql but instead we can use a subquery using SELECT

SELECT product_id, quantity, 
(SELECT AVG(quantity) FROM bakery.ordered_items) as avg_quantity
FROM bakery.ordered_items 

#We can use a subquery in the select statement to look at how much each order is in terms of % of all orders

SELECT product_id, quantity, 
quantity / (SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM bakery.ordered_items) * 100 as percent_of_quantity  #quantity divided by subquery (sum of quantity)
FROM bakery.ordered_items 

#we can also use subqueries in FROM statements to build our own tables but we must give it an alias 

SELECT *
FROM (SELECT product_id, quantity, 
(SELECT AVG(quantity) FROM bakery.ordered_items) as avg_quantity
FROM bakery.ordered_items) AS avg_quant
