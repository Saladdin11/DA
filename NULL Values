#NULL values differ from blank rows as Nulls are not counted when using COUNT functions and so Nulls do not effect Averages as would Blanks which would be counted in a COUNT Function

#Update Tables to change blank '' to NULL so that our counts and averages are not effected in our analysis 
UPDATE bakery.customer_sweepstakes
SET phone = NULL
WHERE phone = '' 

#THere are special functions you can use when working with NULL values 

# Things to consider when working with NULL values 
# - can we keep records that dont have this value? / is the value important? if no just delete it 
# - can we populate this data? can we derive this field from another field or other table? 
# - cam we populate it with an average? / Can we use Imputation models? 

#One of the special functions we can use with NULL values is COALESCE

SELECT AVG(COALESCE(income,0))        #This asks sql to use the null values and replace them with 0 when calc avg
FROM bakery.customer_sweepstakes
