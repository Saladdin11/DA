UPDATING DATA

SELECT* 
fROM EmployeeDemographics1
UPDATE EmployeeDemographics1 
SET EmployeeID = 1012 WHERE FIRSTNAME = 'HOLLY' 

NEW KEYS = 'UPDATE' AND 'SET' 

EXAMPLE 2 - MULTIPLE CHANGES AT ONCE - use a comma 
SELECT* 
fROM EmployeeDemographics1
UPDATE EmployeeDemographics1 
SET AGE = 31, Gender = 'FEMALE' WHERE FIRSTNAME = 'HOLLY' 

DELETING DATA - ALways be careful because you cannot undo this

Delete from EmployeeDemographics1
Where EmployeeID = 1005
